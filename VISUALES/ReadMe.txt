VISUALES
by Karla Tame-Narvaez

VISUALES is an spanish word referring to
different visuals of a given object. The
intention behind the word is that in english
we have VISUAL and SALES. Therefore, VISUALES.

The main goal of the project is to build a
web-app that could take the sales of a given
person and show them visually. So it is pos-
sibble to appreciate which dates of a given
year, month or week could be improved such
that the amount of sales increase.

In a first stage, I used Python3 to code an
algorithm that could distinguish when the
sales have decreased or increased, and thereof
show it visually. 

Later, via HTML5 I created a very simple webpage
that could show my Python code. There, it is
possible to see the logo I created via Procreate.

Of course, I realized there are many things to
improve, but for a one-day coding, I am proud
of the product that I obtained.

This was my first hackathon and my first time
coding HTML5. Also, my first time building a
concept for an app and proposing solutions to
a given problem.

Hope you enjoy my work, which I know is very
simple, but that for my heart was very rich.
